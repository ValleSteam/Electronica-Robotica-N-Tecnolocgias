we don't have the concrete power or speed number,because every customer has different effet of the sample,but you can make follow as reference.
  Cut 2mm Acrylic or plywood set 30%or25%power,30mm/s speed
  Engrave can set 30%or25% power,340mm/s speed.
  same power,slower speed means deeper cutting or engraving
  same speed,bigger power means deeper cutting or engraving
it needs you to adjust the power by your want effect,hope you can understand that.
